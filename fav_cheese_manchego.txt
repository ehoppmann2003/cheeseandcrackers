i actually quite enjoy cheese and crackers
i think it is one of my most favorite snacks
the simplicity of the cracker crunch in addition to rich and creamy cheese will 
ALWAYS be a win in my book

i frankly just love charcuterie in general
i also love to pair crackers and cheese with jamon serrano, a true delicacy 
usually better for this delicious meat and cheese flavor symphony is delicious bread
